            For this assignment you will use your project from the tutorial lab for this module. Perform the following tasks in preparation for the assessment questions for this lab.
            Create a Stack<T> object, of the proper data type, inside the Student object, called Grades, to store test scores.
            Create 3 student objects.
            Add 5 grades to the the Stack<T>  in the each Student object. (this does not have to be inside the constructor because you may not have grades for a student when you create a new student.)
            Add the three Student objects to the List<T>
            Using a foreach loop, iterate over the Students in the List<T> and output their first and last names to the console window. (For this exercise, casting is no longer required.  Also, place each student name on its own line)
            To simulate changing a grade for a student, remove the last entered grade for each student and replace it with a new one.
            Research the Generic collections on http://msdn.microsoft.com and find a Generic collection to store grades in a sorted order.
            Implement that Generic collection in place of the Stack<T> in the Student object.
            Iterate over the student collection and output the first and last name along with each of the 5 grades for that student.
